### CIFAR-100 Image Classification

Your task is to apply the concepts and techniques learned in this Fashion-MNIST project to the CIFAR-100 dataset. CIFAR-100 is a dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Follow these steps:

1. **Dataset Setup:**
   * Load the CIFAR-100 dataset.
   * Preprocess the data (normalize pixel values, one-hot encode labels). Remember that CIFAR-100 images are 32x32 color images, so the input shape will be different from Fashion-MNIST.
   * Verify the shapes of the processed data.
2. **Model Building:**
   * Adapt the ANN and CNN model architectures for the CIFAR-100 dataset. Consider that CIFAR-100 images are color (3 channels) and have a different resolution (32x32). You might need to adjust the input layer and potentially the number of filters or layers in the CNNs for better performance on a more complex dataset.
3. **Model Training:**
   * Train the models using the preprocessed CIFAR-100 training data. Use Early Stopping and Model Checkpointing as implemented before.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Evaluate the trained models on the CIFAR-100 test set. Compare their performance using loss and accuracy.
   * Visualize training history and confusion matrices.
5. **Prediction Analysis:**
   * Choose the best performing model and analyze its predictions on the CIFAR-100 test set.

**Goal:** To understand how model complexity and architecture choices impact performance on a more challenging image classification dataset like CIFAR-100.

## Project Summary and Conclusion (CIFAR-100)

This project successfully applied deep learning models (ANN, Basic CNN, and Deeper CNN) to the more challenging CIFAR-100 image classification dataset, following the workflow established in the Fashion-MNIST project.

**Summary of Work:**

1. **Dataset Preparation:** The CIFAR-100 dataset was loaded, normalized, and one-hot encoded, adapting to its 32x32 color image format.
2. **Model Development:** ANN, Basic CNN, and Deeper CNN architectures were adapted for CIFAR-100, considering the input shape and increasing the complexity for the deeper model.
3. **Model Training:** Each model was trained on the CIFAR-100 training data using Early Stopping and Model Checkpointing.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained models were evaluated on the CIFAR-100 test set, comparing their loss and accuracy. Training history and confusion matrices were visualized to provide a comprehensive view of their performance.
5. **Prediction Analysis:** Predictions were analyzed using the best performing model (Deeper CNN), and examples of correctly and incorrectly classified images were visualized.

**Key Findings and Conclusion:**

Based on the evaluation results for CIFAR-100:

* The **Deeper CNN model** achieved the highest test accuracy and lowest test loss among the three models, demonstrating the benefit of a more complex CNN architecture for a more challenging dataset like CIFAR-100 compared to Fashion-MNIST.
* The **Basic CNN model** performed significantly better than the ANN, reinforcing the effectiveness of convolutional layers for image data, even on a more complex dataset.
* The **ANN model** struggled considerably with the CIFAR-100 dataset, achieving a much lower accuracy compared to its performance on Fashion-MNIST. This highlights the limitations of simple ANNs for complex image classification tasks with higher resolution and more classes.

In conclusion, for the CIFAR-100 dataset, increasing model complexity from a basic CNN to a deeper CNN with techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout resulted in improved classification performance. This contrasts with the Fashion-MNIST project where the Basic CNN was sufficient. This project demonstrates that the optimal model architecture is dependent on the complexity and characteristics of the dataset. Further optimization of hyperparameters and exploration of more advanced CNN architectures could potentially lead to even higher accuracies on CIFAR-100.
